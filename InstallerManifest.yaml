    Changelog:
      - Shortcut switching has been redesigned. It should hopefully be more reliable now, and window focus should no longer be lost at times.
      - The "Launching..." popup that Steam shows when starting a non-Steam shortcut is now gone! This also appears to speed up launching of shortcuts.
      - The shortcuts created by this extension can now be launched from the Steam library!
      - Launching the "Playnite Overlay" from Steam will now start Playnite, and closing it will start Steam BPM.
      - Playnite game images will now be carried over to the non-Steam shortcut in the Steam library, if possible.
      - The default GlosSITarget settings have been updated, for example to not show the GlosSI logging.
      - Various bug fixes.
      - Added Spanish, Chinese (Simplified) and French translations. Thanks, Madcore, BennyDung and enzomtp!
      - This update has been long-overdue, most of these changes were implemented a year ago. I had simply not released them yet, due to fear of introducing new bugs. If you encounter any, please report them!
      - Since maintenance of GlosSI has stopped for the time being, the future of this extension is uncertain...
